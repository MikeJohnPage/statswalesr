# rstatswales

rstatswales is a package for downloading data from StatsWales to your R environment. This functionality
is limited to datasets that are available through the OData feed. You can check this by navigating to your
desired dataset, scrolling to the bottom, and checking that the "Dataset" link is available under the Open Data tab.

## Installation

**This package is still in development**. You can install the latest version of rstatswales from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jamie-ralph/rstatswales")
```
## Example

In the code below, I'm extracting data on [aircraft movement at Cardiff airport]("https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Transport/Air/aircraftmovementsatcardiffairport-by-movementtype-year").

```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results="hide"}
library(rstatswales)

df <- rstatswales::get_dataset("tran0003")
```

```{r}

str(df)

```
